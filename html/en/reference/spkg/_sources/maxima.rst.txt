maxima: System for manipulating symbolic and numerical expressions
==================================================================

Description
-----------

Maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical
expressions, including differentiation, integration, Taylor series,
Laplace transforms, ordinary differential equations, systems of linear
equations, polynomials, and sets, lists, vectors, matrices, and tensors.
Maxima yields high precision numeric results by using exact fractions,
arbitrary precision integers, and variable precision floating point
numbers. Maxima can plot functions and data in two and three dimensions.

   the upstream/ directory.

2. Update package-version.txt and run 'sage --package fix-checksum'.

3. Make sure the patches still apply cleanly, and update them if
   necessary.

4. Test the resulting package.

All patch files in the patches/ directory are applied. Descriptions of
these patches are either in the patch files themselves or below.

-  0001-taylor2-Avoid-blowing-the-stack-when-diff-expand-isn.patch:
   Fix for Maxima bug #2520 (abs_integrate fails on abs(sin(x)) and
   abs(cos(x))). Introduced in Trac #13364 (Upgrade Maxima to
   5.29.1).

-  build-fasl.patch: Build a fasl library for ecl in addition to an
   executable program. Introduced in Trac #16178 (Build maxima fasl
   without asdf).

-  infodir.patch: Correct the path to the Info directory. Introduced
   in Trac #11348 (maxima test fails when install tree is moved).

-  matrixexp.patch: Fix matrixexp(matrix([%i*%pi])), which broke after
   Maxima 5.29.1. Introduced in Trac #13973.

-  maxima.system.patch: Set ``c::*compile-in-constants*`` to t.
   Introduced in Trac #11966 (OS X 10.7 Lion: Maxima fails to build).
