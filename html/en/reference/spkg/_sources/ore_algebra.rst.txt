ore_algebra: Ore algebra
========================

Description
-----------

A Sage implementation of Ore algebras, Ore polynomials, and differentially
finite functions.

Main features for the most common algebras include basic arithmetic and
actions; gcrd and lclm; D-finite closure properties; creative telescoping;
natural transformations between related algebras; guessing; desingularization;
solvers for polynomials, rational functions and (generalized) power series.
Univariate differential operators also support the numerical computation of
analytic solutions with rigorous error bounds and related features.

Equivalent System Packages
--------------------------


See https://repology.org/project/ore-algebra/versions

However, these system packages will not be used for building Sage
because ``spkg-configure.m4`` has not been written for this package;
see :issue:`27330` for more information.
