.. _spkg_xindy:

xindy: a general-purpose index processor
========================================

Description
-----------

This dummy package represents xindy: xindy was developed after an impasse had been encountered in the attempt to complete internationalisation of makeindex. Xindy can be used to process indexes for documents marked up using (LA)TEX, Nroff family and SGML-based languages. Xindy is highly configurable, both in markup terms and in terms of the collating order of the text being processed.

We do not have an SPKG for it. The purpose of this dummy package is to
associate system package lists with it.
