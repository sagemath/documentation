Dependencies
------------

To install, nothing more than a standard Sage install. The
``spkg-check`` script will exit without actually testing anything if it
cannot find "latex" in your path.

Notes
-----

To use SageTeX, both Sage and LaTeX need to know about it. SageTeX comes
standard with Sage, so you only need to make sure LaTeX can find what it
needs. Full details are in the Sage installation guide at
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/ and
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/sagetex.html .

The directory ``$SAGE_ROOT/venv/share/doc/sagetex`` contains
documentation and an example file. See
``$SAGE_ROOT/venv/share/texmf/tex/latex/sagetex`` for the source code
and some possibly useful scripts. If you have problems or suggestions
see `the sage-support
group <http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support>`__.

If you want to help develop SageTeX, please clone the github repository
(see the "Upstream Contact" above) and send me patches based on that.
