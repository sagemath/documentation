freetype: A free, high-quality, and portable font engine
========================================================

Description
-----------

From the documentation:

FreeType is a software font engine that is designed to be small,
efficient, highly customizable, and portable while capable of
producing high-quality output (glyph images). It can be used in
graphics libraries, display servers, font conversion tools, text image
generation tools, and many other products as well.

Note that FreeType is a font service and doesn't provide APIs to
perform higher-level features like text layout or graphics processing
(e.g., colored text rendering, ‘hollowing’, etc.). However, it greatly
simplifies these tasks by providing a simple, easy to use, and uniform
interface to access the content of font files.

Please note that ‘FreeType’ is also called ‘FreeType 2’, to
distinguish it from the old, deprecated ‘FreeType 1’ library, a
predecessor no longer maintained and supported.

The package in Sage is called freetype (in lowercase).
