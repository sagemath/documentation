SageMath fully supports all major Linux distributions, recent versions of
macOS, and Windows (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

The traditional and recommended way to install SageMath is from source via
Sage-the-distribution (https://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html).
Sage-the-distribution first builds a large number of open source packages from
source (unless it finds suitable versions installed in the system) and then
installs the Sage Library (sagelib, implemented in Python and Cython).


About this experimental pip-installable source distribution
-----------------------------------------------------------

This pip-installable source distribution `sagemath-environment` is an
experimental distribution of a small part of the Sage Library.  Use at your own
risk.  It provides a small, fundamental subset of the modules of the Sage
library ("sagelib", `sagemath-standard`), providing the connection to the
system and software environment.  It also includes the `sage` script for
launching the Sage REPL and accessing various developer tools (see `sage
--help`).
