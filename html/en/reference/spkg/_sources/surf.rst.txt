surf: Visualization of algebraic curves, algebraic surfaces and hyperplane sections of surfaces
===============================================================================================

Description
-----------

surf is a tool to visualize some real algebraic geometry: plane
algebraic curves, algebraic surfaces and hyperplane sections of
surfaces. surf is script driven and has (optionally) a nifty GUI using
the Gtk widget set.

This is used by the Singular Jupyter kernel to produce 3D plots.
