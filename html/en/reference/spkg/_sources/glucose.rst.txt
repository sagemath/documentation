glucose: A SAT solver
=====================

Description
-----------

Glucose is a SAT solver.

Citing its website:

  The name of the solver is a contraction of the
  concept of "glue clauses", a particular kind of clauses that glucose
  detects and preserves during search. Glucose is heavily based on
  Minisat, so please do cite Minisat also if you want to cite Glucose.

-  parallel glucose-syrup: MIT modified with:

   The parallel version of Glucose (all files modified since Glucose 3.0
   releases, 2013) cannot be used in any competitive event (sat
   competitions/evaluations) without the express permission of the
   authors
   (Gilles Audemard / Laurent Simon). This is also the case for any
   competitive
   event using Glucose Parallel as an embedded SAT engine (single core
   or not).
