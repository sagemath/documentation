rubiks: Programs for Rubik's cube
=================================

Description
-----------

There are several programs for working with Rubik's cubes, by three
different people. Look inside the directories under /src to see specific
info and licensing. In summary the three contributers are:

Michael Reid (GPL)
http://www.cflmath.com/~reid/Rubik/optimal_solver.html

-  optimal - uses many pre-computed tables to find an optimal
   solution to the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube

Dik T. Winter (MIT License)

-  cube - uses Kociemba's algorithm to iteratively find a short
   solution to the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube
-  size222 - solves a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube

Eric Dietz (GPL) https://web.archive.org/web/20121212175710/http://www.wrongway.org/?rubiksource

-  cu2 - A fast, non-optimal 2x2x2 solver
-  cubex - A fast, non-optimal 3x3x3 solver
-  mcube - A fast, non-optimal 4x4x4 solver

Type
----

optional

However, these system packages will not be used for building Sage
because spkg-configure.m4 has not been written for this package;
