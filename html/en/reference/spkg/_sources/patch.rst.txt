patch: Applies diffs and patches to files
=========================================

Description
-----------

'patch' takes a patch file containing a difference listing produced by
the 'diff' program and applies those differences to one or more original
files, producing patched versions.

The version of 'patch' included is the GNU one. Some of the 'diff' files
produced by GNU 'diff' are not acceptable to some versions of the 'patch'
command, such as the 'patch' command that comes with Solaris.
