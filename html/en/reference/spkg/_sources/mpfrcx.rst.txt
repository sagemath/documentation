mpfrcx: Arithmetic of univariate polynomials over arbitrary precision real or complex numbers
=============================================================================================

Description
-----------

Mpfrcx is a library for the arithmetic of univariate polynomials over
arbitrary precision real (Mpfr) or complex (Mpc) numbers, without
control on the rounding. For the time being, only the few functions
needed to implement the floating point approach to complex
multiplication are implemented. On the other hand, these comprise
asymptotically fast multiplication routines such as Toom–Cook and the
FFT.
