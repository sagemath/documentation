setuptools_wheel: Build the setuptools package as a wheel
=========================================================

After installing setuptools and wheel, we build a wheel of setuptools
to complete the set of wheels stored in our wheelhouse.

This version of setuptools is suitable for PEP 517/518/660 builds,
but it is not suitable for building ``numpy``.

Type
----

standard


Dependencies
------------

- $(PYTHON)

- :ref:`spkg_wheel`

Version Information

    # We use this file to mark the package as a Python package


Equivalent System Packages
--------------------------

See https://repology.org/project/python:setuptools/versions


However, these system packages will not be used for building Sage
because using Python site-packages is not supported by the Sage distribution;
see :trac:`29023`
