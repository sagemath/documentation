kissat: SAT solver
==================

Description
-----------

From the package README::

    KISSAT is a "keep it simple and clean bare metal SAT solver" written in C.
    It is a port of CaDiCaL back to C with improved data structures, better
    scheduling of inprocessing and optimized algorithms and implementation.

    Coincidentally 'kissat' also means 'cats' in Finnish.

From the website::

    The Kissat SAT solver is a condensed and improved reimplementation of
    CaDiCaL in C.

    Kissat won first place in the main track of the SAT Competition 2020 and
    first place on unsatisfiable instances.
