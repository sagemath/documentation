Topology
========

Sage includes some tools for topology, and in particular cell
complexes: (filtered) simplicial complexes, `\Delta`-complexes, cubical
complexes, and simplicial sets.  A class of generic cell complexes is
also available, mainly for developers who want to use it as a base for
other types of cell complexes.
